# Oldagram 📸

Oldagram is a simple social media feed clone inspired by Instagram.  
It dynamically renders posts and allows users to **like posts by clicking the heart icon or double-clicking the image**.

This project was built to practice **JavaScript DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **CSS layout styling**.
